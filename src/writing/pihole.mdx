## Motivation

In 2026, I feel we don't code a lot (I personally try to), Now It's mostly tab tab tab...... So I decided to buy a Raspberry Pie 5 and tinker with it. I started researching on what things I could run on rpi5 and cam across hosting my own dns and network level ad blocker. I was intrigued and started setting up [pihole](https://pi-hole.net) on the pie. It's not that difficult to run it, if you're comming from a technical background but for the sake of my own knowledge and maybe building a habit of writing things down in this ai world (lol).

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi, [zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) also works or any device that can run linux and connect to your home network
- Access to your router, mine is available at [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1/)
