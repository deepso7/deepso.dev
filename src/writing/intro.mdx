Hi, I'm Deepanshu—a full-stack engineer passionate about WebRTC, real-time communication, and distributed systems.

For the past 4.5 years, I worked at [Huddle01](https://huddle01.com) as the Founding and Lead Engineer. I led a development team of 10-12 engineers. During my time at Huddle01, we built:

- **Scaled WebRTC & WebSocket Infrastructure**

  Architected and implemented "Cascading," a horizontally partitioned WebRTC SFU topology inspired by database sharding. This enabled us to reliably support 10,000+ concurrent users per room with sub-100ms latency, significantly improving global latency and bandwidth efficiency.
  Migrated from JSON to Protobufs, reducing message size by 60% and more than doubling throughput per WebSocket instance (we use [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js))

- **NFT indexing service**

  Built an NFT indexer because [phantom](https://phantom.com) acquired [simplehash](https://simplehash.com) and shut it down. Used Rust to leverage memory safe multithreading and indexed and cached a few terabytes of NFTs in S3 bucket.

- **Designed and developed various SDKs**

  Architected frontend and backend SDKs for interacting with our real-time communication service with a nice easy to use DX and flexibility to mould it into any requirements.

- **Architected recording service**

  Developed a recording service using ffmpeg, puppeteer, xvfb, pulse audio, node.js and typescript, and deployed using kubernetes, which helped in auto-scaling pods whenever there was high load.

- **Managed deployment pipeline**

  Deployed services to bare metal servers to save costs and set up CI/CD pipeline to deploy on bare metal. Earlier used AWS to deploy service to lambda and fargate.

- **Migrated from Monolith to Modular Architecture**

  Led the transition from a tightly coupled monolithic system to a modular, event-driven architecture using gRPC. This allowed independent scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and clearer ownership, boosting developer productivity and operational stability as our engineering team grew.

- **Led the team to build various client facing products**

  Huddle01 meeting app, dashboards for managing meetings, chrome extension, gcal adons, node sales platform, [farhouse](https://house01.fun).

## **Side Projects**

- **Pingo** - [https://github.com/deepso7/pingo](https://github.com/deepso7/pingo)

  A Rust library for peer-to-peer latency measurement using STUN and UDP hole punching. This helped me figure out a very basic idea on how I can calculate latency between 2 peers.

- **Matrix** - [https://github.com/deepso7/matrix](https://github.com/deepso7/matrix)

  Rust based lib/api for spinning up lightweight microVMs using [**Firecracker**](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io) or [**Cloud Hypervisor**](https://www.cloudhypervisor.org). This helped me understand how microVMs work and how easily I can spin up microVMs.

Cheers,<br />
